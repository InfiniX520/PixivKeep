"""Read-only preflight and file-set backups for the library database.

The download core validates every declared SQL object character by character
before it opens a library (LibraryRepository._inspect_existing), so an operator
needs one answer before switching builds: will this build accept this file, and
what does going back look like if it does not.  This module answers that
without writing to the inspected database and produces a backup a human can
restore by hand.

Safety rules this module keeps:

- inspect_library, verify_library_copy and switch_plan open the database
  through a 'file:...?mode=ro' URI.  They never execute a write PRAGMA (no
  wal_checkpoint, no journal_mode=, no VACUUM, no BEGIN IMMEDIATE) and they
  never create the file.  Opening a WAL database read-only still makes SQLite
  create its own bookkeeping beside it, an empty -wal and the -shm
  shared-memory index (measured).  Neither carries library content, both are
  rebuilt on the next open, and the database bytes never move.
- The declared schema is imported from core.library_repository.  A second copy
  of 49 statements would drift on the next schema change, and the drift would
  be invisible exactly where the check has to be exact.
- A backup has two modes.  'online_backup' is the default: it asks SQLite for
  a consistent snapshot through a read-only source connection, so a live app
  keeps writing while the snapshot stays consistent and uncommitted rows stay
  out.  'file_group' copies main, -wal and -shm byte for byte and therefore
  requires a quiet source.  Either way the manifest is written last and any
  failure removes the run's own directory, so a directory that contains a
  manifest is a directory that verified.

What "compatible" means here is what the code will actually do, not a tighter
rule of our own: extra objects are reported and tolerated (the repository only
iterates its own declaration), while a missing object, a one-character text
difference, a wrong format/version marker or a failed quick_check is not
compatible.
