"""Whole-library scan aggregation (contract v6 section 3.2).

The engine in core.library_audit answers one page at a time and its API is
frozen: it reports how much of the library *that page* covered, never what the
library as a whole holds.  This module is the layer above it.  It walks pages
from the head (or from one explicit cursor), accumulates every verdict and
derives the single answer a maintenance command may print.

Three rules make that answer honest:

* A page is a page.  Reaching the end of the ledger is a fact about the walk,
  not about the last response: only a walk that started at the head and never
  stopped for a budget, a cancellation or a ledger failure may say "complete".
* A continuation says nothing about the whole library.  It has no row count,
  its prefix is unproven, and the most it may report is "these rows were
  examined"; a bare cursor can therefore never produce exit code 0, even when
  it happens to land on the last page.
* Severity is monotone.  One missing or changed file on page 1 of 3 is exit 2
  even when pages 2 and 3 are entirely green; a ledger that dies on page 2 is
  exit 3 even when page 1 was green.  A later page never overwrites an earlier
  finding.

Nothing here writes.  The engine opens one short read transaction per page, so
a long walk does not pin the WAL or hold a connection while hashing, and the
report states explicitly that a multi-page walk is not one point-in-time
snapshot of the library.

The public entry point is::
